# Blackjack Game

This is a simple **Blackjack** game written in Python. The game follows the standard Blackjack rules and allows you to play against the computer.

## How to Play

- The game starts by dealing **two cards** to you and one to the computer.
- You can choose to **draw another card** (`'y'`) or **stop** (`'n'`).
- The goal is to get as close to **21** as possible without exceeding it.
- If your total exceeds 21, you **lose**.
- The computer will continue drawing cards until its total is at least **17**.
- The player with the highest valid score **wins**.
- If both have the same score, it's a **draw**.

## Features

âœ… Handles **Aces** (11 or 1) correctly to prevent busting.  
âœ… Implements the **dealer rule** (dealer stops at 17 or higher).
